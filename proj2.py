# IMPORTANT NOTE:
"""
If you are getting "encoding errors" while trying to open, read, or write from a file, 
add the following argument to any of your open() functions:

    encoding="utf-8-sig"

An example of that within the function would be:
    open("filename", "r", encoding="utf-8-sig")

There are a few special characters present from Airbnb that aren't defined in standard UTF-8 
(which is what Python runs by default). 
This is beyond the scope of what you have learned so far in this class,
